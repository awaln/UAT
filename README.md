## Notes
Some of the JavaScript is . . . unfortunately styled. This is because I made the unfortunate decision to use CoffeeScript at one point in time. This has stopped, but some code remains.

## Problems with organizer
The organizer was supposed to be able to, given a graph, organize it such that it's mostly top-to-bottom. I thought the way to do this would be with finding the longest path in the graph. This, as it turns out, is NP-hard. That being said, assuming my graphs are always rather small, it may not be as awful as it seems?

But _something_ should still be done this week! So instead, maybe focus on the moving-things-around bit.
